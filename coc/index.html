          <p class="text-body text-body--medium">
            BarCamp Philly has a long history of implicitly supporting a safe and positive environment for speakers and BarCampers to gather, converse, and explore varied interests. The intent has always been to encourage the best of the community, and in large measure, the community responds magnificently. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-body text-body--medium">
            We, as organizers, understand that this community deserves the opportunity to continue to put its best foot forward, and so we have decided to make explicit the policy that we have always felt was so implicitly a part of the BarCamp Philly culture. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-body text-body--medium">            
            BarCamp Philly’s Safe Space policy is intended to help BarCamp Philly be a supportive, as well as non-threatening environment for all who participate. We want this space to be welcoming and engaging, and we encourage everyone — visitors, event presenters, volunteers, and collective members — to be proactive in creating an atmosphere where the safety and individual rights of others is valued. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-body text-body--medium">            
            What that demands is that everyone involving themselves with the BarCamp Philly event are required to be aware of their language and behavior, and to think about whether it might be harmful to others. We define oppressive behavior as any conduct that demeans, marginalizes, rejects, threatens or harms anyone on the basis of ability, activist experience, age, cultural background, education, ethnicity, gender, immigration status, language, nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, self-expression, sexual orientation, status as a parent or other such factors.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body text-body--medium">            
            By attending BarCamp Philly and participating in BarCamp Philly events and activities, you agree to abide by these guidelines:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-body text-body--medium">
              Be considerate of other people. Respect everyone’s boundaries. Check in before discussing topics that might be triggering (e.g. sexual abuse, sexual experiences, physical violence, or encounters with the police)
            </li>
            <li class="text-body text-body--medium">
              Use Trigger Warnings before presenting topics which might elicit an emotional response. A decent, but not exhaustive example of trigger warnings and what they imply can be found here: <a target="_blank" class="anchor-inline" href="https://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Trigger_warning">https://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Trigger_warning</a>
            </li>
            <li class="text-body text-body--medium">
              Be responsible for your own actions. Be aware that your actions have an effect on others, despite what your intentions may be. It is the impact your actions have not the intention you have that matters.
            </li>
            <li class="text-body text-body--medium">
              Be aware of your prejudices and privileges, and biases you assume while participating in BarCamp Philly.
            </li>
            <li class="text-body text-body--medium">
              Respect the pronouns and names of everyone. Do not assume anyone’s gender identity, sexual preference, survivor status, economic status, background, health, etc.
            </li>
            <li class="text-body text-body--medium">
              Respect people’s opinions, beliefs, experiences and differing points of view. It is easy to forget that behind an opinion is another human being. 
            </li>
            <li class="text-body text-body--medium">
              Respect the sobriety policy of the space. If someone is observed to be obviously intoxicated, they will be asked to leave the venue.
            </li>
            <li class="text-body text-body--medium">
              Address any discomfort you may experience to a BarCamp organizer. You may find organizers throughout the venue wearing purple BarCamp shirts.
            </li>
            <li class="text-body text-body--medium">
              Attendees who are wearing red lanyards have specifically asked to not be photographed; those wearing yellow lanyards would like to be asked before agreeing to be photographed. Refrain from photographing, videotaping, recording or otherwise capturing someone’s likeness if they tell you it is making them uncomfortable or ask you politely not to.
            </li>
            <li class="text-body text-body--medium">
              Masking guidelines are consistent with the current government guidelines. A person’s preference to wear a mask must be respected.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="heading-secondary">Dealing with Conflict</div>
          <p class="text-body text-body--medium">
            While it will be impractical for the organizers to prescreen or otherwise vet the content of every virtual talk we encourage two things - if you experience any elements you find uncomfortable during a talk/presentation: Please use the “rule of two feet” and feel free to leave any talk or discussion you find uncomfortable. Further, please feel free to make mention of your discomfort to one of the organizers. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-body text-body--medium">            
            If you experience harassment, or any form of abuse, or if a perpetrator is interfering with your participation or presence in BarCamp’s activities, please approach any BarCamp Philly organizer. The organizers are here to acknowledge, and attempt to help with any conflicts arising from the violation of our policies. You may find organizers throughout the venue wearing purple BarCamp shirts.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body text-body--medium">                        
            Our Safe Space policy aspires to approach the Safer Spaces policy at: <a target="_blank" class="anchor-inline" href="https://saferspacesnyc.wordpress.com/">https://saferspacesnyc.wordpress.com/</a>  
          </p>
          <p class="text-body text-body--medium">            
            We will be looking for opportunities to improve both our commitment to creating and maintaining a safe space for everyone. We welcome continuing discussion to further improve this policy.
