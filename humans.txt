# THANKS

    A big thanks to the creative folks of the city of Philadelphia for making BarCamp Philly as awesome as it is by curating such incredible talks over our ten year history. A shout out to our sponsors as well who without their support we wouldn't have the opportunity to put on such a large event every year.
