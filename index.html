          <h2 class="heading-primary">What is a BarCamp?</h2>
          <p class="text-body text-body--medium">
            BarCamp is an “unconference“ – a full day of up to 66 sessions, over
            6 timeslots, in 11 rooms at Wharton's Huntsman Hall where attendees
            build the schedule the morning of the event. Sessions are given on a
            variety of topics, and the day is created collaboratively – built by
            the people, for the people.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-secondary">How does it work?</h3>
          <ul class="list-body">
            <li>
              If you want to give a talk or host a session, you can write out a
              card with the talk name and details and hand it to a volunteer at
              the board, who will schedule your time. Getting there close to
              8:15am to post your talk means more options.
            </li>
            <li>
              At 9:30, attendees and speakers alike will be able to vote by
              placing a sticker on the card of a talk they want to attend. The
              card with the most stickers will get a larger room with more seats
              – no talk will be kicked off the board, however. Fewer votes just
              means a smaller room for a more intimate conversation with the
              audience.
            </li>
            <li>
              At 10, we'll kick off the day with opening remarks, send everyone
              on their way to the first session, and the board-building can
              resume, with new talks being added throughout the morning. You can
              come check out the board anytime, or access our digital schedule
              on any device to see the latest and greatest talk times and rooms.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="heading-secondary">Can I give a talk?</h3>
          <p class="text-body text-body--medium">
            Of course! We encourage anyone interested in giving a talk to post
            their topic on the board. But giving a talk – whether it's your
            first year or your tenth – is not required. Most people are there to
            listen, learn and discuss in sessions and don't necessarily lead a
            session.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-secondary">What kind of talks?</h3>
          <p class="text-body text-body--medium">
            Topics vary from the technical (“Wordpress Child Themes”) to the
            inspiring (“Running: Not Just for the Zombie Apocalypse”). From
            practiced talks (“Designing for People”) to open discussions (“Nerds
            w/ Kids Roundtable”). Also, if you don't like the talk you're in,
            use the “rule of two feet” to get up and go to a different talk.
